                    <p>This game is an interactive quiz where users answer a series of multiple-choice questions one at a time. Each question is displayed with several answer options, and the user selects their answer by clicking a radio button.

This process repeats until all questions have been answered. At the end of the quiz, the game displays the user's total score, showing how many questions were answered correctly out of the total number of questions. This structure allows for an engaging and dynamic quiz experience, providing immediate feedback at the end.
